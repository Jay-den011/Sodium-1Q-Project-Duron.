                Sexuality is but one of many areas where religious and civic authority interact; definitions of the
                purpose of marriage is another. In one view, the purpose of marriage is to ensure successful procreation
                and child rearing. In another, marriage provides a healthy relationship—and perhaps the—fundamental
                building block of stable
                communities, with procreation as an incidental by-product. A third perspective holds that marriage is an
                instrument of societal domination and so is not desirable. A fourth is that relationships between
                consenting adults should not be regulated by the government. Although most religions subscribe to just
                one of these beliefs, it is not uncommon for two or more viewpoints to coexist within a given society.

                On July 19, 2011, the Obama administration announced that it would support a bill by Sen. Dianne
                Feinstein (D-CA) to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). This followed President Obama’s decision
                on Feb. 23, 2011 to instruct the Justice Department to stop defending DOMA, the federal law that defines
                marriage as a legal union between a man and woman, over concerns that it violates the equal protection
                component of the Fifth Amendment. [57][58]

                On May 9, 2012, President Obama became the first sitting US president to declare his support for gay
                marriage, stating: “At a certain point, I’ve just concluded that for me personally it is important for
                me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married.” [64]

                On June 26, 2013, the US Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision in United States v. Windsor declared
                unconstitutional part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) which defined marriage solely as a
                legal union between a man and a woman. The decision allowed same-sex married couples to receive the same
                federal benefits granted to heterosexual married couples, including tax breaks and pension rights.
                [74][75]

                Also on June 26, 2013, and also in a 5-4 decision, the US Supreme Court ruled in Hollingsworth v. Perry
                that proponents of California’s Proposition 8 lacked “standing” to defend the anti-gay marriage measure
                after it had been ruled unconstitutional by a District Court. The decision was considered to clear the
                way for gay marriage to become legal again in the state. [76][77]

                In 2013 and 2014, following the US Supreme Court’s United States v. Windsor decision, gay marriage bans
                were overturned by court rulings in several states, but those rulings were put on hold pending appeals
                to the US Supreme Court. On Oct. 6, 2014, the Supreme Court declined to hear appeals from five of those
                states, and the decision immediately cleared the way for legal gay marriage in Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah,
                Virginia, and Wisconsin. Six other states in which gay marriage bans had been overturned, Colorado,
                Kansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, and Wyoming, were also affected by the Supreme
                Court ruling because they were in the jurisdictions of the lower courts that had overturned the gay
                marriage bans. [81]

                Even though the legal rights and responsibilities of civil partnership and
                marriage are almost identical, the two are not perceived as of equal
                status and value. Civil partnership is seen as a legal contract, while
                marriage is seen by many as the gold standard for celebrating the joy of
                love and commitment. Marriage is very widely understood for its
                symbolism and its personal, community, and in some cases, religious
                significance. Very few people propose to their partner by asking “Will
                you civil partner me?” civil partnership just does not have the same
                meaning.
                Civil partnership was invented specifically to deny same-sex couples
                access to marriage, and is seen by many same-sex couples as a
                second-class status.
                Put simply, equality means making the same choices available to all. If
                mixed-race couples were denied the opportunity to marry, and instead
                offered civil partnership with the same legal effects, that would readily be
                seen as unacceptable racist discrimination. The ban on same-sex
                couples marrying is equally unacceptable.
