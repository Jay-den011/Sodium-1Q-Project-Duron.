                hi, my name is kitkat i am a CS3 Student from philippine science high school student Batch '29! I was
                tasked to make a website
                about a specific issue. My topic is same sex marriage.
            </p>

                <p>
                    the reason why i picked same sex marriage is because same-sex marriage should be legalized because all
                    people deserve equal rights, including the freedom to marry the person they love. Denying this right
                    is a form of discrimination and goes against the principles of fairness and human dignity.
                    Legalizing same-sex marriage promotes acceptance, strengthens families, and ensures that all couples
                    receive the same legal protections and recognition.
                    </p>
